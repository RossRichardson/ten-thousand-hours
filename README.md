> **The premise is that: 10,000 hours is the amount of practise required to have mastery over something**

Let's see if I can stick to the challenge of accumulating 10,000 hours of code practice.

## Practise Log

### What is practise?

Practise is deliberate and intentional practise. Proficiency assessments don't count, but some things that do are:
- Code reviews
- Reading tutorials or slides (video or text)
- Interactives - like [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/)
- And writing code of course!
- Discussing concepts, syntax, idioms and the like

### Updates

#### 2019-06-04
I've been using Java a lot more recently but i'm still finding time to learn more about Go. Today I had a look at structs and interfaces. I find the best learning tools right now are; https://tour.golang.org, https://gobyexample.com/ and https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/

I also found https://gokit.io/examples/stringsvc.html enjoyable. The go-kit site and examples are beautifully written and concise.

#### 2019-05-28
It's been tough to grab time to practise. I haven't been logging code reviews of Go code though. So I'm going to include that in my time.


## Assessments
Assessments are done with Pluralsight although I'm certainly open to suggestions for better methods or services to use.

Scheduled Go and Java Assessment

#### 2019-05-23

Done. 51st percentile isn't so bad for only 4 months of, relative, tinkering.
Yikes. I'm a little shocked looking at that Java test score. Something is Going on there so I'll retake that in a month.
Also saw I had a Git score. 231. Glorious!
