> **The premise is that: 10,000 hours is the amount of practise required to have mastery over something**

Let's see if I can stick to the challenge of accumulating 10,000 hours of code practice.

### What is practise?

Practise is deliberate and intentional practise. Proficiency assessments don't count, but some things that do are:
- Code reviews
- Reading tutorials or slides (video or text)
- [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/)
- And writing code of course!
- Discussing concepts, syntax, idioms and the like

### Updates

#### 2019-05-28
It's been tough to grab time to practise. I haven't been logging code reviews of Go code though. So I'm going to include that in my time.

Done. 51st percentile isn't so bad for only 4 months of, relative, tinkering.
Yikes. I'm a little shocked looking at that Java test score. Something is Going on there so I'll retake that in a month.
Also saw I had a Git score. 231. Glorious!
